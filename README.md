Intro To Computer Graphics Final Exam


Graphical enhancement of super mario world

<img width="727" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4858ca05-173f-4f2b-b6ee-f37a5acea293">

In this scene I used A hologram shader, a colour correction post process shader, A toon shader, and a scrolling texture.

I decided that the best way to show this graphical enhancement was to recreate the first part of a level in super mario world. 

The player has the ability to move around in the level.
