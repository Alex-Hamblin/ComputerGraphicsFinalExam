In this scene I used A hologram shader, a colour correction post process shader, A toon shader, and a scrolling texture, as well as a rim shader, each of these shaders have been customized for this exam. 

I decided that the best way to show this graphical enhancement was to recreate the first part of a level in super mario world. 

The player has the ability to move around in the level. I chose to do this as i felt it was a better and more dynamic way of showing off the shaders created for this exam.
